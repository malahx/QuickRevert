#### What is it ?

QuickRevert is a small plugin which add the possibility to keep/pay the revert function.

#### How does it work ?

You will lose the revert function if:
- you launch a new vessel,
- you stand too long (15 mins) outside the vessel (space center, tracking station, another vessel ...),
- you can't pay a revert (only for career).

You will keep the revert function if:
- you go to the space center or on another vessel,
- you make a quickload,
- KSP crash,
- you stop your game,
- the launched vessel is loaded,
- you are on EVA.

#### How to update it?

Unzip all files. Merge the new QuickRevert folder with the old folder which is in your KSP/GameData folder.

#### How to uninstall it ?
