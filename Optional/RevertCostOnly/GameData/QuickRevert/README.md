#### What is it?

QuickRevert is a small plugin which adds the possibility to keep/pay the revert function.

#### How does it work?

You will lose the revert function if:
* you launch a new vessel,
* you stand too long (15 mins) outside the vessel (space center, tracking station, another vessel ...),
* you can't pay a revert (only for career).

You will keep the revert function if:
* you go to the space center or on another vessel,
* you make a quickload,
* KSP crash,
* you stop your game,
* the launched vessel is loaded,
* you are on EVA.

#### How to install it?

Unzip all files. Put the QuickRevert folder in your KSP/GameData folder.

#### How to update it?

Unzip all files. Merge the new QuickRevert folder with the old folder which is in your KSP/GameData folder.

#### How to uninstall it?

Delete the QuickRevert folder in your KSP/GameData folder.
